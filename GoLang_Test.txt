Most computer software used to be written with its ultimate users clearly in mind. A computerinstallation had its own programmers who would write user-specific software. Even if software fromoutside was used, it was frequently modified locally to suit the idiosyncrasies or particular applications ofeach installation. Computers were expensive, programmers less so.But computers have become much cheaper, and are now commonplace at work and at home. There isa corresponding explosive growth in the amount of software available. Computers and software arebecoming mass-market merchandise. Users frequently buy general-purpose software, expecting it toinclude enough functionality to cover their applications.The user no longer has a programming staff to fall back on. How then can he make a general-purposesystem into a special-purpose one that suits his needs? The system might provide the mechanism for theuser to do his task, but if it requires seventeen general-purpose operations to do what could take onespecial-purpose operation, the user will be frustrated and annoyed. One solution is to let the user do hisown programming. Certainly we should not expect the average user to write programs with the same easeas professional programmers. (See [Anderson] and [Cuff] for general discussions about the problems ofintroducing programming to the average person.) What we can do instead is to find ways to makeprogramming easier, to couch it in terms with which the user is familiar, and to reduce the mental burdenof programming.Programming by the user has already appeared in a number of different ways. The degree of userprogrammability can vary from choosing among options the system provides, to systems which requireprogramming by the user as an integral part of their functionality.For user programming in its simplest form, systems provide options or modes from which the usercan choose in order to customize the operation of the program. For instance, a program that prints mightprovide an option of single or double spacing. Though it might be stretching a point to call this realprogramming, the system is supplying a very simple, specialized programming language.
